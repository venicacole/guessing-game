// console.log("hello world")

// 1. Research the `Math.random()` method to learn how to generate a random number. The number should be between 1-50.
// 2. Give a user a prompt to guess the random number. NOTE: You will need to keep track of the number of guesses a user has used.
// 3. Use if/else and truthy/falsy concepts to evaluate whether or not the user's guess was correct.
// 4. NOTE: If a user's guess is incorrect, respond with a prompt letting them know whether or not their guess was too high or too low and how many chances remain.
// 5. If a user guesses within three chances, display an alert letting the user know they've won and what the number was.
// 6. If a user loses, display an alert letting the user know they have lost and reveal the number.

//Prompt for Name
let playerName = prompt("Hey! What's Your Name?");
console.log("The player's name", playerName);






//const randomNumber = Math.floor(Math.random() * 50 + 1;
